üßê About The Project
This project is a user-friendly desktop tool designed for writers, students, and educators. It provides a simple interface to check for plagiarism within a self-contained database and offers an AI-powered rewriting feature to help generate unique content. All submissions are stored locally in an SQLite database, allowing the plagiarism checker's effectiveness to grow over time as more documents are added.

‚ú® Key Features
Plagiarism Detection: Compares submitted text against all previously stored entries to find similarities.

AI-Powered Rewriting: Integrates an AI model to paraphrase and rewrite the text, helping to create unique versions.

Multiple Input Methods: Users can either paste text directly into the text box or upload a file (.txt, .docx, etc.).

Local Database Storage: All submissions are saved to a local SQLite database, creating a private and expanding repository for plagiarism checks.

Export Results: Allows users to save the plagiarism report and the rewritten text for their records.

Toggle Dark/Light Mode: Includes a theme-switching option for user comfort.

Progress Indicator: A progress bar provides visual feedback during the checking and rewriting process.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Input: The user enters a title and provides text by pasting it or uploading a file.

Submission: Upon clicking Submit & Check + Rewrite, the application saves the submission to the plagiarism_checker.db SQLite database.

Plagiarism Check: The application's algorithm compares the new text against all existing content entries in the database to calculate a similarity score.

AI Rewrite: Simultaneously, the text is processed by an AI model to generate a rewritten, unique version.

Display Results: The plagiarism findings and the newly rewritten text are displayed in the "Plagiarism Check & Rewrite Results" area.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: Python

GUI: A Python framework like Tkinter, PyQt, or CustomTkinter.

Database: SQLite3 for local data storage.

NLP/AI:

Libraries like NLTK or spaCy for text processing.

A sequence-to-sequence model (like T5) or an LLM API for the rewriting functionality.

Similarity algorithms (e.g., Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF) for the plagiarism check.
